# Temperature-Converter

#This temperature Converter takes a numeric value as input from the user. This numeric value is the current temperature.
#It then asks the unit for the current temperature . It then asks the unit that the user wants to convert it to.
#The script then converts it to the new unit and then gives it as the output.
# It starts the program once again unless the user chooses to stop it by choosing (No)"n" in the last step.
